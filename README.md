# Yuletide Shiver - A Choose Your Own Adventure Story
Welcome to Yuletide Shiver, a choose your own adventure story! This project is the result of a one week Hack Sprint at Holberton Tulsa.

You hail from a small town in frozen New England, but opportunity has come knocking. A new job offer means it's time to leave the place you've called home. You'll have to make a stopover in Greenwood as the journey is long. Surely it won't be too much of a hassle...

## Infrastructure
This project is hosted on FireBase using the FireBase SDK. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the Front-End, and JavaScript is used in conjunction with FireBase/FireStore for the Back-End.

## Retrospective/Stretch-Goals
The theme for our one week Hack Sprint was "Winter". After some initial brainstorming, we landed on a choose your own adventure story. During the course of the project, we ultimately decided to switch from a back-end running MySQL/Flask, to one run primarily on FireBase. The only two major hurdles we found ourselves facing involved tracking/accessing our data stored in FireStore, and learning how module/package bundling works in JavaScript.

If we had more time, the following features were next in line to be implemented:
* Implementing hotkeys for choice selection
* Expanding the story, adding endings, and randomizing story pathing
* Implementing a story progress bar
* Implementing a save feature
* Adding a settings menu
