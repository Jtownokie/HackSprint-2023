Intro:
&emsp; The sun slowly rises in the sky, even with its comforting light, you begin to feel the cold seep into your bones despite your heavy coat and gloves by the time you reach the bus halt in front of Osborn’s Drug Store. It’s a relief to put down your heavy cases and take off your hat for a moment. You fan your face. It has been a long summer here, in your hometown, and yet a curiously empty one. <br>&emsp; You look across the street at the grubby butcher’s shop, the grocers with its faded awning, and the shabby tobacconist. Mistrustful faces glare at you as they pass, eyeing your clothes and luggage. It was your parents’ choice to live here, not yours. You were happy down south as a child, among Providence’s white-walled houses and leafy churchyards. Perhaps this new job in Arkham will supply the change you need. <br>&emsp; Yet everybody you know in the world lives here. You know nobody in Arkham, not one soul. You ask yourself one last time if you are doing the right thing. <br>&emsp; The answer is here. None of your supposed friends have come to see you off. You are alone. Whatever challenges lie in Arkham, it will be a new life, and a brave one. <br>&emsp; A small gray motor coach approaches and rattles to a stop. You put your hat back on and pick up your cases. The driver, a large man with many scars possible from the great war, opens the door and ushers you to your seat, introducing himself “names James, where too” ? You stow your cases above your set “Ossipee”. <br>&emsp; “Well that is about a day's drive, we'll have to be stopin’ in Greenview for the night.” I must have shown my worry, because James assures you we would be able to keep to your time table, “Just a quick stop over for a good meal and a warm bed. “Good news is there’s no more stops before we make it to Greenview.” <br>&emsp; You settle in and as leafless trees begin to pass by you fall into a restless sleep.

I1:
&emsp; You were startled awake by a sudden violent turn. You see James struggling with the wheel, ice, it had to be ice, your cases were being tased from the luggage rack. You reach out quickly in an attempt to save the last case from being thrown to the floor and its contents from being ruined.
