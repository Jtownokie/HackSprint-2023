Intro:
&emsp; The sun slowly rises in the sky, even with its comforting light, you begin to feel the cold seep into your bones despite your heavy coat and gloves by the time you reach the bus halt in front of Osborn’s Drug Store. It’s a relief to put down your heavy cases and take off your hat for a moment. You fan your face. It has been a long summer here, in your hometown, and yet a curiously empty one. <br>&emsp; You look across the street at the grubby butcher’s shop, the grocers with its faded awning, and the shabby tobacconist. Mistrustful faces glare at you as they pass, eyeing your clothes and luggage. It was your parents’ choice to live here, not yours. You were happy down south as a child, among Providence’s white-walled houses and leafy churchyards. Perhaps this new job in Arkham will supply the change you need. <br>&emsp; Yet everybody you know in the world lives here. You know nobody in Arkham, not one soul. You ask yourself one last time if you are doing the right thing. <br>&emsp; The answer is here. None of your supposed friends have come to see you off. You are alone. Whatever challenges lie in Arkham, it will be a new life, and a brave one. <br>&emsp; A small gray motor coach approaches and rattles to a stop. You put your hat back on and pick up your cases. The driver, a large man with many scars possible from the great war, opens the door and ushers you to your seat, introducing himself “names James, where too” ? You stow your cases above your set “Ossipee”. <br>&emsp; “Well that is about a day's drive, we'll have to be stopin’ in Greenview for the night.” I must have shown my worry, because James assures you we would be able to keep to your time table, “Just a quick stop over for a good meal and a warm bed. “Good news is there’s no more stops before we make it to Greenview.” <br>&emsp; You settle in and as leafless trees begin to pass by you fall into a restless sleep.

I1:
&emsp; You were startled awake by a sudden violent turn. You see James struggling with the wheel, ice, it had to be ice, your cases were being tased from the luggage rack. You reach out quickly in an attempt to save the last case from being thrown to the floor and its contents from being ruined.

I2:
&emsp; You were startled awake by a sudden violent turn. You see James struggling with the wheel, ice, it had to be ice, your cases were being tased from the luggage rack. you hold onto the seat in front of you and allow your cases to strike the floor of the motor coach, I hear the sound of breaking glass from my luggage.

Prompt A:
&emsp; The motor car lurched to a halt as the right side slowly became lower the floor gaining a sloop to the right. The sudden stop of the motor car as you were reaching for your suitcase caused you to roll your ankle.  <br>&emsp; James was shaking slightly, from the stress of maintaining control of the vehicle, before he remembered he had a passenger “You ok?” You explain that you think you rolled your ankle trying to save some of your luggage. James mutters something under his breath before he hands you a first aid kit and tells you to prop up your foot while he looks over the motor car for damage. <br>&emsp; “Well I got some good news and some bad news. The good news is I was medic in the war and I have your ankle able to carry your weight in no time. The bad news is that the motor car ain’t going anywhere and it's a two mile walk to Greenview.” <br>&emsp;James bandaged your ankle and made it to where you could walk in a relative lack of pain. He also gave you cane from the lost and found to help with the trek. As he maneuvers the motor car to the side of the you already feel the cold stealing the warmth away from you, the suitcase heavy in your hand. <br>&emsp; James reappears from the door, ”We should have enough light to be able to make it to Greenview, even with that bad ankle”, he holds out his flask, “here take a swig, it's going to be a long walk and it's cold as hell.” <br>&emsp; The next hour was nothing but a slow trudge ahead with a silent companion only occasionally taking sips from his flask and muttering when you have to take breaks. Mercifully the cold has numbed your ankle and is keeping the worst of the pain at bay. <br>&emsp; Finally you arrive at a small village with only a few small businesses around the town square and several houses creating small pathways with their proximity to the town walls. The town appears to be preparing for a festival with three large spruce trees being set up in the town square. “I forgot it was festival time, well at least there will be a bit of fun to be had, but I’m not going to be able to get anyone to help get the motor car running until tomorrow, Lucy normal has a room to rent for a small fee her house is one street down,” he pointed to the east, “ and about half a block north, it the only two story, you can miss it, in the meantime i’m going to find a place for myself, I'll meet you in the town square tomorrow.” James was to one of the busier buildings in the town square, with a garish sign reading “Sargent’s Place.”

A1:
&emsp; Feeling adventurous, you decide to explore the festival preparations in the town square before seeking out Lucy's house. You can feel your ankle begin to throb and the can even feel small hints of a larger pain, but your curiosity has got ahold of you and you need to learn what this festival is about.

A2:
&emsp; You make your way to Lucy's house to find a place to rest for the night. By the time you arrive your ankle is beginning to throb even through the numbness. As you make it up the final stairs to the door you are greeted by the door suddenly opening and a small figure runs into you.

Prompt B:
&emsp; The motor car lurched to a halt as the right side slowly became lower, the floor gaining a slope to the right. The sudden stop of the motor car caused your cases to strike the floor, and the sound of breaking glass echoed from your luggage.James, visibly shaken from the stress of maintaining control of the vehicle, turned to you. “You okay?” he asked. You nodded, though you were concerned about the potential damage to your belongings. <br>&emsp; James muttered something under his breath before handing you a first aid kit, instructing you to check for injuries while he inspected the motor car for damage. You check your suitcase and find only one of your family photos broken, a minor inconvenience. <br>&emsp; Well, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is I was a medic in the war, and I can fix you up if needed. The bad news is that the motor car ain’t going anywhere, and it's a two-mile walk to Greenview.” James made a quick assessment of your condition and, satisfied that you weren't seriously injured, handed you a cane from the lost and found. <br>&emsp; As he maneuvered the motor car to the side, you already felt the cold stealing the warmth away, the suitcase heavy in your hand. James reappeared from the door. “We should have enough light to make it to Greenview. It's going to be a long walk, and it's cold as hell.” He held out his flask for you to take a swig. <br>&emsp; The next hour was nothing but a slow trudge ahead, with a silent companion occasionally taking sips from his flask. Mercifully, the cold numbs your senses, making the walk bearable. <br>&emsp; Finally, you arrived at a small village with only a few small businesses around the town square and several houses creating small pathways with their proximity to the town walls. The town appeared to be preparing for a festival, with three large spruce trees being set up in the town square. <br>&emsp;  “I forgot it was festival time. Well, at least there will be a bit of fun to be had. But I’m not going to be able to get anyone to help get the motor car running until tomorrow. Lucy normally has a room to rent for a small fee. Her house is one street down,” James pointed to the east, “and about half a block north. It's the only two-story; you can't miss it. In the meantime, I’m going to find a place for myself. I'll meet you in the town square tomorrow.” James headed to one of the busier buildings in the town square, with a garish sign reading “Sargent’s Place.”
